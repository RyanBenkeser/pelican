## Day 40 of Quarantine

My name is Ryan Benkeser and I am starting the Data Deductions blog today.  Why am I doing this, you ask?

Great question! The answer is very complex and multifaceted -- it is Day 40 of the Covid-19 quarantine in San Francisco.  My boredom compels me.

A California native, I studied Economics at UC Berkeley, worked at Cisco Systems in Silicon Valley, and then transitioned my career arc towards data science at ThousandEyes, an international network intelligence company.  

The goal of this blog is to share cool data trends across a wide array of subjects.  It will cross the chasms of Economics, Finance, Sports, Politics, the Environment and everything in between.  Can we make deductions from data?

Stay tuned for weekly blog updates!
