I miss basketball.  I miss Kobe Bryant.  As a millenial Southern California native, I idolized Kobe Bryant.  I remember where I was when Kobe captured his first championship.  I remember where I was when Kobe lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2008 NBA Finals.  I remember where I was when Kobe hugged the ball in the waning seconds of Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals.  I remember where I was when Kobe dropped 60 in his final game.  And I remember where I was when news spread of Kobe's passing.  Bryant is my Jordan.  I work a little harder each day because Bryant worked harder each day.  To pay homage to Bryant's illustrious NBA career, I visualized all of Kobe's shots in one chart.
