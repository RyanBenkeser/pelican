## The Spread of Coronavirus
In this post we'll see how coronavirus is spreading around the world.  The first visualization is a racing bar chart by country.  The second visualization is an international geographical mapping using Python. Which visualization do you like better? Do you think the United States is doing enough, not enough or just the right amount to stop coronavirus? Add your comments in the section below.

<h1>Racing Bar Chart (Fluorish Studio)</h1>
I created the racing bar chart example below around April 13th.  The process itself to create the visualization was remarkably easy.  You do not even need to know how to code.  With some basic Microsoft Excel CSV upload in a standardized format, it was really easy to upload the data and for the visualization to render.  If you want to see the details of this Flourish studio visualization or build your own charts from these visualizations, please feel free to explore <a href="https://app.flourish.studio/visualisation/1907728/">the visualization</a> on your own.

<h1>World Map (Jupyter Notebooks)</h1>
The next video is a geographical mapping of the spread.  I built it in Jupyter Notebooks with the Plotly package.  If you know Python and are willing to read through some Plotly and/or Matplotlib documentation, much of this visualization is also abstracted for you to construct yourself.  Free free to visit my <a href="https://github.com/RyanBenkeser/COVID-19/blob/master/COVID19_World_Growth.ipynb">COVID19 Repo</a> to explore the visualization on your own!

Good luck and hopefully you can start rending your own data visualizations.  

Signing off on Sunday, April 25th 2020.
